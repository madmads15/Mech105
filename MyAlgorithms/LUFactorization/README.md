# LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting Algorithm

This algorithm determines the LU Factorization of a square matrix. When given a system, LU Factorization solves the system and creates a matrix that can solve the system even when the answers of the system are changed. This code also uses partial pivoting which pivots the matrix so that it can be solved more efficiently and have a perfect lower and upper triangular matrix.
## Inputs

A - coefficient matrix (can be any inputed size but must be square)

## Outputs

L - lower triangular matrix

U - upper triangular matrix

P - the pivot matrix
