# Mech105
Algorithms Developed for Mech105

This repository contains all of the Matlab algorithms that I have created for Mech 105.

Those algorithms include:

1. False Position Algorithm

2. LU Factorization Algorithm

3. Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm

Each folder in this repository has the Matlab code for each algorithm and their OWN README.md file that explains the code in detail.
