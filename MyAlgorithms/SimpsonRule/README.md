# Simpson's 1/3 Rule Algorithm

This algorithm evaluates the integral of an inputed vector of function values "y" with respect to "x" using Simpson's 1/3 Rule. This inputed vector must contain an odd number of intervals and if not, the algorithm defaults to using the Trapezoidal Rule for the last interval. In the command window the user must input an x and y vector before calling the function Simpson(X,y).

## Inputs

x - a vector with equal step sizes

y - a vector that must be the same size of x

## Outputs

I - the answer to the integral
